*********************** Replication codes for ************************
** "Uncertainty and economic activity: A multi-country perspective" **
********** by A. Cesa-Bianchi, M.H. Pesaran, and A. Rebucci **********

**********************************************************************
To replicate the main results of the paper run "GO_CPR.m". 
The code reads from "DATA.xlsx" and stores the results in "Output".
The folder "Codes" includes all the relevant routines. Please make sure 
to add this folder (together with all subfolders) to your Matlab path 
before running "GO_CPR.m". 
The code has been tested with Matlab R2017b.
